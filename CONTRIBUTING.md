## Cutting a release

1. Run `bundle exec rake release` and follow the prompts.
2. Wait for the [GitHub Action release workflow](https://github.com/Shopify/blake3-rb/actions/workflows/release.yml) to finish.
3. After the release workflow finishes, use the [ShipIt UI to publish the release to Rubygems](https://shipit.shopify.io/shopify/blake3-rb/release)
